# 2024-03-01 - Day #001

A friend convinced me to take part in the [100 Commits](https://100commitow.pl/) competition. Since few months I wanted to write something for Atari 2600. I thought that the competition could be good occassion to have some fun and learn something completely new. So I decided to write a game for the Atari as a part of the competition. I have an idea for the game, but I won't reveal it yet.

I started preparations few weeks ago. I install tools and configure the environment. I started reading books:

1. Nick Montfort, Ian Bogost - [Racing the Beam](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262539760/racing-the-beam/) - it contains Atari 2600 platform analysis and also analysis of some famous games, from the developer's point of view.
2. Jan Ruszczyc - [Asembler 6502](https://retronics.eu/?a=item&id=20&l=pl) - how to use 6502 assembler. Although Atari 2600 contains 6507 processor, but it is stripped down version of 6502, so the knowledge won't be wasted.

I almost failed on the first day. Contest's rules says at least one commit by the repo author is needed. I had a wrong email address in my git configuration, so my previous commits were accounted to the different Github users! Fortunately, I noticed it.

# 2024-03-02 - Day #002

I spent night reading Batari Basic documentation and "kernels" descriptions here: [https://www.randomterrain.com/atari-2600-memories-batari-basic-commands.html](https://www.randomterrain.com/atari-2600-memories-batari-basic-commands.html)

It looks like that limitations are everywhere. I started to think how to workaround them, for example, how to make a bigger player sprite.
