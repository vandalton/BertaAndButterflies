# Berta And Butterflies

In this repository hopefully you will find a game for Atari 2600 one day.
The project will consists not only of a code, but also a cartridge design, labels, box - all stuff needed to create a game that could be run on a real machine. 

## History

I started this project to take part in [100 Commits](https://100commitow.pl/) competition.

Recently I was fascinated by Atari 2600 console and I wanted to write a program for it, which is allegedly very hard. This machine has only 128 bytes of RAM (it's not a mistake) and has no graphics memory at all. There is even no such term as 'pixel'. 

I want to check how hard it really is. I have no prior experience with 6502/6507 assembler, Batari Basic etc. The competition motivates me to learn it :)

More details [diary](./DIARY.md).
