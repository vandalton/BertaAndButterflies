In this folder you can find a program for Atari 2600 that communicates with [RTC](../../hardware/atari2600-rtc/README.md).

It is at experimental stage, but it kind of works :)

## The Idea

I designed this adapter primarily for my game - **Berta and Butterflies**. I wanted to make the game more similiar to the "Game & Watch" LCD game and display current time at title screen. It's a gadget, not a must have feature, but I'm determined to do it eventually.
