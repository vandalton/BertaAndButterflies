In this folder you can find a program for Atari 2600 that communicates with [RTC circuit](../../hardware/atari2600-rtc/README.md).

It is at experimental stage. It reads a current time from the circuit and displays it as a score, but there is no way to set the clock.

## The Idea

I designed this adapter primarily for my game - **Berta and Butterflies**. I wanted to make the game more similiar to the "Game & Watch" LCD game and display current time at title screen. It's a gadget, not a must have feature, but I'm determined to do it eventually.

<!-- ## Support the project

This design is open-source and you can download gerber files and order profesionally made PCBs from any manufacturer. However, you can order them from PCBWay: [https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/SNES_controller_adapter_for_Atari_2600_DB9_a7f10165.html](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/SNES_controller_adapter_for_Atari_2600_DB9_a7f10165.html) - in this case I'll receive a few pennies, which will support this project or my other projects. Thanks! -->
